!!! warning "In Development"
    OrbitalTrajectories.jl and its documentation is currently in development
    and is provided as a pre-1.0 release.

    The interfaces (exported types/functions) here may, and most likely will, change in
    future updates, possibly breaking any existing code using OrbitalTrajectories.jl.
    
    While these interfaces are being developed, the documentation provided
    here is of very limited use. For now, please instead refer to the
    tutorials/examples which will be kept up-to-date as best as possible.
